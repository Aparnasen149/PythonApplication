# PythonApplication

I have created a small application using python that will read a file from the current directory and execute the corresponding 
action as chosen by the user.

For example:

Count : It will give the count of lines and words in the file chosen.
Maximum Word Count : It will display the word with maximum occurence.If there are more than one word with same maximum occurences, will
display all of them.
Top n common words : It will display all the top n common words.
Minimum Word Count : It will display the word with minimum occurence.If there are more than one word with same maximum occurences, will
display all of them.
Pallindromes in the File : It will display all the pallindromes present in the file.
Anagrams in the File : It will display all the anagrams present in the file.
